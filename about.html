                <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
                <p>With nearly 25 minutes of experience in JavaScript, I am most likely your strongest candidate. 
                  I don't like to brag, but sometimes you just know when you're the best. I have encountered countless struggles while working with 
                  html and css. Most of them have been resolved, while some remain a mystery. I have no intention of bettering myself because I 
                  already feel I have more to offer than your company deserves. To be quite frank, you should be submitting your portfolio to me.</p> 
                
                <p>Very few web developers have reached my level of expertise, where I can confidently say I have completed at least 5% of a JavaScript codecademy course.
                  I tried to go to Harvard and get my Bachelor's in computer science, but they told me I was so advanced it just wouldn't be worth my time.
                  I feel I really jive with your team, and I look forward to working with them and putting them down daily.</p>
